## About

## Bio

Almost whole my life I were developing applications for users (for those who use and for those who produce). I released som products with the help of [`django`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fieldsets), [`qooxdoo`](https://qooxdoo.org/), [`react`](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/bv9nxf/react_sucks/), [`unity`](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/sep/12/unity-engine-fees-backlash-response), and we saw a lot of shit with [`godot`](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/terraria-developer-re-logic-donates-100k-to-godot-engine-and-fna/) recently. Those events gave rise to a lot of trauma in me. I were never truly sarisfied as software engeneer and application devlopoer.
